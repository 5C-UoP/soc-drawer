          """The IT Society is a place to hang with people with a passion for all things computing or those who are interested. Providing a platform for students to social network, learn and enhance their skills, while also facilitating those students who have a wilder side, wishing to relax and let their hair down in the evening and unplug from the internet of things.

          We host numerous socials, workshops, talks, and excursions throughout the year. Things to expect are:

          • Lightning Talks from Industry leaders. Includes free food and drink!

          • Social Nights

          • Hacktoberfest Workshops, earn a free T-Shirt!

          • Seasonal Meals

          • Participate in computing events (Cyber Security Challenge)

          • Interview Challenges, and a platform to apply for industrial placements

          The best part is that membership is FREE! We welcome all students from across the university to get involved for whatever reason, JUST GET INVOLVED, GET COMPUTING!!!
